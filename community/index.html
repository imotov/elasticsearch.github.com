<h1>Mailing List</h1>

<p>
    <a href="/community/forum">ElasticSearch User</a> is the mailing list where <strong>elasticsearch</strong> users come to <em>seek help, announce projects, and discuss</em> all kind of matters surrounding the <strong>elasticsearch</strong> and the community.

</p>

<h1 id="irc">IRC</h1>

<p>
    Sometimes its just easier to get help or discuss matters in real time. The <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/elasticsearch">#elasticsearch</a> channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em> allows for just that (<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat.freenode</a>). Note: IRC discussions tend to exclude large parts of the community. Therefore elasticsearch core technical discussions and decisions must take place on the mailing lists, not IRC. They don't count otherwise.
</p>

    This site itself is <a href="http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.github.com">hosted at GitHub</a> as well. One great way to help around with <strong>elasticsearch</strong> is by <a href="contributing-site.html">contributing</a> to it.
