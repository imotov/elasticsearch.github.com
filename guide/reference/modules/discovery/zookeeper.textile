p. ZooKeeper discovery is using "Apache ZooKeeper":http://zookeeper.apache.org/ for automatic discovery and fault detection. It doesn't use multicast and can be used in environments that don't support multicast. Here is a simple sample configuration:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
discovery:
    type: zookeeper
    zookeeper.client.host: localhost:2181
</pre>

p. You'll need to install the @zookeeper@ plugin, by running @bin/plugin install zookeeper@ before (re)starting elasticsearch. You will also need to have a "ZooKeeper":http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html server running.

p. The ZooKeeper discovery plugin accepts the following settings (prefixed with @discovery.zookeeper.client@) that can further control the discovery:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@host@|A comma-separated addresses of the ZooKeeper services.|
|@root@|The name of a ZooKeeper node that should be used for storing discovery information. Defaults to @es@.|
|@session.timeout@|The session timeout. Defaults to @1m@.|
