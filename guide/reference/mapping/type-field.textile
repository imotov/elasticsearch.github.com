p. Each document indexed is associated with an id and a type. The type, when indexing, is automatically indexed into a @_type@ field. By default, the @_type@ field is indexed (but *not* analyzed) and not stored. This means that the @_type@ field can be queried.

p. The @_type@ field can be stored as well, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "_type" : {"store" : "yes"}
    }
}
</pre>

p. The @_type@ field can also not be indexed, and all the APIs will still work except for specific queries (term queries / filters) or faceting done on the @_type@ field.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "_type" : {"index" : "no"}
    }
}
</pre>
