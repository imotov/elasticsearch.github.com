p. Each shard has a transaction log or write ahead log associated with it. It allows to guarantee that when an index/delete operation occurs, it is applied atomically, while not "committing" the internal lucene index for each request. A flush ("commit") still happens based on several parameters:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|index.translog.flush_threshold_ops|After how many operations to flush. Defaults to @5000@.|
|index.translog.flush_threshold_size|Once the translog hits this size, a flush will happen. Defaults to @500mb@.|
|index.translog.flush_threshold_period|The period with no flush happening to force a flush. Defaults to @60m@.|
